# btwifi

you have to login to btwifi/btopenzone hotspots every couple of hours.

this script checks if the internet connection is active by requesting the captive portal detect url from firefox and sending the same post request that the browser sends when logging in

this was tested with a bt broadband account, the login request might be different for btfon accounts or bt business broadband accounts

change the sleep time if you want 


### usage:

insert your email and password 

run the script
